# Pass-Fail Analysis Function

The Pass-Fail Analysis Function is a function created within the Zoho CRM to look at the Property Database Module, compare Seller's Desired Net field and Conservative Net to Seller Field, and change the Status to "Pass/Fail Analysis" based on whether Desired Net is less than or equal to Conservative Net Seller.
